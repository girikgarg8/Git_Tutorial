`git init` --> Powers your folder to be managed by Git, and initialises a new empty repository. It also creates a .git folder that has also the relevant logic to manage different versions of your project.

`Working Area` --> There can be a bunch of files that are not currently handled by git. It means that changes done or to be done in those files are not maanged by git yet. A file which is in working area is considered to be not in the staging area. When we do `git status` and we see a bunch of 'untracked files' then these are actually called to be in the working area.

`Staging area` --> What all files are going to be a part of the next version that we will create. This staging area is the place where git knows what changes will be done from the last version to the next version.
